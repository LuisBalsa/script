# script

**Fun prank for 42 classmates ðŸ˜„**

This script adds a small "troll" into `.bashrc` and `.zshrc`:

- Disables `Ctrl+C` (`SIGINT` trap)
- Runs Star Wars in ASCII (`telnet starwarstel.net`)
- Then enters an infinite spinner loop

> Meant for fun and harmless pranks inside the 42 environment ðŸ˜‰
